    <ul>
        <li>¾ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

        <li>2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups chicken stock, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>⅓ cup diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup thinly sliced celery</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 dash hot sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper for garnish</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked rice, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>For the spice blend: Whisk paprika, thyme, oregano, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, white pepper, and black pepper together in a small bowl.</li>

        <li>For the étouffée: Drain shrimp in a colander for at least 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl lined with paper towels and dry shrimp for about 3 minutes. Remove paper towels from the bowl. Season shrimp with salt and 1 teaspoon spice blend; toss to coat.</li>

        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat until oil is smoking. Cook shrimp in hot oil without stirring for 1 minute; stir, and cook 1 minute more.</li>

        <li>Transfer shrimp to a large bowl. Let stand until juice collects in the bowl. Strain shrimp juices into chicken stock to total 2 cups, adding more chicken stock if necessary. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat until butter begins to turn tan at the edges. Sauté onion, bell pepper, and celery in hot butter until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining spice blend.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle flour into vegetable mixture and sauté until combined, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; cook until tomato juices begin to brown on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes. Whisk in chicken stock mixture, stirring until smooth. Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened and reduced to a gravy consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in Worcestershire and hot sauce. Season with salt to taste.</li>

        <li>Stir shrimp into étouffée sauce; let simmer until shrimp are cooked all the way through and no longer translucent, about 1 minute.</li>

        <li>Garnish with green onions and a dusting of cayenne pepper. Pour over rice in large, shallow bowls.</li>
    </ol>
